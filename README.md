# Doctor Who Memory Game

This application is a Doctor Who themed memory game built using react.js.

The object of the game is to click on a different image every turn, and never click on the same image twice.

Once an image is clicked on, all the images are shuffled around on the page. 

The app keeps track of the user's current score, as well as their high score.
